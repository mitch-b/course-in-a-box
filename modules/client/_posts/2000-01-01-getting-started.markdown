# Setting Up Your Project

Let's kick off this lab by building a very simple client which will try to parse an OData endpoint and display a list of objects based on the response it receives querying the entity set.

## Creating the UI5 Project

1. Open Eclipse Luna
1. If prompted, create a new workspace at `[your preferred directory]\workspaces\odata-lab`

1. If presented with welcome screen, click the Workbench icon in the top right of this view.
1. Create a new project by choosing the New Project icon, and choosing 'Projectâ€¦'
1. Search in filter for 'ui5' and click Next

1. Set application name as : 'ODataLabClient'
1. Set library as 'sap.m' and leave 'Create an Initial View' checked.
1. When creating the initial view, set Name to 'App' and leave JavaScript development paradigm checked. Click Finish.
1. If you are prompted to open the Java EE perspective, you can switch to it if you'd like.
