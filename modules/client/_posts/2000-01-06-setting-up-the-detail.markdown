# Setting up the Detail View

Just like we set up our Master view, we'll do exactly the same with our Detail view. In our detail view, we hope to display:

* Sales Order Number
* Sold To Account
* Amount

Any time our master list changes, our detail list should update with new values as well.

## Create a new View

1. Right click on the `view` folder
1. Choose New > Other &hellip;
1. Type view in the filter box. Choose view under SAPUI5 Application Development folder.

1. Enter `Detail` as the view name and choose XML development paradigm.
